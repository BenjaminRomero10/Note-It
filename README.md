# Note-It update 0.2 changelog

## _What's new?_

After a hard-working and endless hours, finally here's this update that changes this interactive simulation website in every way!

Below, the points we are going to talk about.

- Design.
- Sign in and Sign up with storage and JSON.
- ✨Coming soon✨

=======================================================================================

## Design

As is know, the old design was actually garbage, mostly in the color set. Some of changes I did are the following next.

- Change the "dark" theme for a minimalist and pleasant-view theme, but keeping some of those like secondary colors.
- Divide the text with format of "task->date" in two different texts in the tasks container.
- Add two news containers of "Sign Up" and "Sign In".

## Sign in and Sign up with storage and JSON

After my class in CoderHouse about Storage and JSON, I needed proving my knows. So, thats the reason why add this new components. Note that, being a simulator, these "sessions" only work on local storage, but it's still fun to play with.

## ✨Coming soon✨

Some features that I want to add coming soon are the next.

- Improve design even more.
- Add responsive support.
- Add options to mark or delete completed tasks.

=======================================================================================

Finally, it only remains to continue working on improving this small and beloved project.
