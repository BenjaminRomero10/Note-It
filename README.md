# _What's new?_

## Note-It update 0.3 changelog
Finally, the update I was waiting for arrived, so that my project can be seen from any device. Ladies and gentlemen, here is Note It's version 0.3 for all of you.

Below, the points we are going to talk about.

- Responsive Design.
- New alerts.
- ✨Coming soon✨

### Responsive Design
I could notice that in the previous version, even though it looked good, on mobile devices the page was destroyed. For this reason, I worked on adding a responsive design so that you can enjoy the web application from anywhere.

- Addition of hamburger menu on mobile devices to be able to log in or create an account.

### New alerts
It was to be known that the previous alerts when you made a mistake when logging in or creating an account were ugly!

- Addition of new alerts in all possible cases, thanks to the "Sweet Alert 2" and "Toastify" libraries.

### ✨Coming soon✨

Some features that I want to add coming soon are the next.

- Add option to log out.
- Add options to mark or delete completed tasks.

## Thank you for reading this!

## Note-It update 0.2 changelog 

After a hard-working and endless hours, finally here's this update that changes this interactive simulation website in every way!

Below, the points we are going to talk about.

- Design.
- Sign in and Sign up with storage and JSON.
- ✨Coming soon✨

### Design

As is know, the old design was actually garbage, mostly in the color set. Some of changes I did are the following next.

- Change the "dark" theme for a minimalist and pleasant-view theme, but keeping some of those like secondary colors.
- Divide the text with format of "task->date" in two different texts in the tasks container.
- Add two news containers of "Sign Up" and "Sign In".

### Sign in and Sign up with storage and JSON

After my class in CoderHouse about Storage and JSON, I needed proving my knows. So, thats the reason why add this new components. Note that, being a simulator, these "sessions" only work on local storage, but it's still fun to play with.

### ✨Coming soon✨

Some features that I want to add coming soon are the next.

- Improve design even more.
- Add responsive support.
- Add options to mark or delete completed tasks.


Finally, it only remains to continue working on improving this small and beloved project.
